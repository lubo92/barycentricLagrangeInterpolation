# Barycentric Lagrange Interpolation

## Literature and Mathematical Background
The code provided in this package closeley follows this paper:

[Berrut, Jean-Paul, and Trefethen, Lloyd N. "Barycentric lagrange interpolation." SIAM review 46.3 (2004): 501-517.] (https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/barycentric.pdf)

## What does this package provide?
This package provides the functioalities to interpolate a one dimensional function known at some sampling points with a barycentric Lagrange method. Furthermore you can differentiate the interpolated function. Also higher derivatives are supported. All this functionality is implemented within a Python class in numpy. Plots are provided by matplotlib.

In order to make application easier, an example Jupyter notebook is also included.
